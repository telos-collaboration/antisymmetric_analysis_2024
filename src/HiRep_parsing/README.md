### HiRepParsing

A tool for parsing output files of [HiRep's](https://github.com/claudiopica/HiRep) output files generated by the `Spectrum/measure_spectrum` program. It supports parsing the log files and saving them to an `hdf5` file.

#### Instructions

- Make sure that [julia](https://julialang.org/) version 1.10 or newer is installed on your system
- To install all julia dependencies execute the following commands in a julia session started in this directory

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.instantiate()
```

- Run the script that you want to execute (e.g. `scripts/write_chimera.jl`) in that julia session with the command `include("scripts/write_chimera.jl")`

- Alternatively, you can run it from your favourite shell. Include the above code snippet at the start of the script, and then run `julia scripts/write_chimera.jl`
